### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Patricia and I'm Data Analyst with over ten years of experience in the Tech industry. I am skilled in Python, SQL, and Tableau with a strong passion for uncovering data insights.

My expertise in data science is complemented by my extensive consulting, operations, and project management background, which allows me to take a unique approach when analyzing problems and exploring creative solutions.

I am a proactive problem-solver who thrives in fast-paced environments and enjoys collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality work. 

Fun facts: 
- I'm originally from Argentina, so I'm bilingual in Spanish. 
- I'm interested in healthy living and longevity.
- I love travelling and experiencing new cultures.
